-if it seems wrking and still getting the errors -> rerun the server

-in views.py :
    seperate always into 2 type: 
    -> fuction_name_view: get html files 
    -> function_name: controllers
     and do not mix them

-to add css:
    static/css/style.css
    base.html : {% load static%}
                href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}"

ex: for buttons:  diplay and margin workd together
    display: block ;
    margin: auto;


================================13
passing context dictionary to redirect method -> is not possible : except by yrl
to display messages : use messages methode


================================14
you should add href=/adminlogout to avoid appending to url. if still not working, restart the server

IMPORTANT: if css not updated -> delete chrom's cash : ctr+shift+delete
be carful for indentation errors
